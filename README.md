# Little Python Book

This is a new book I have started to teach programming using Python and
micro:bit devices. I will try to keep this book simple enough so that 11 years
old kids (the actual recipients of the devices) can understand, and have fun
with learning programming.

The latest version of the book is available in the readthedocs website.
